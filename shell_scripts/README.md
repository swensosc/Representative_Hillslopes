## `hand_analysis_loop.sh`

This script performs the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) analysis for each gridcell. It breaks the analysis into a number of chunks---by default, 36---to enable parallel processing using batch submission scripts. Do
```bash
./hand_analysis_loop.sh --help
```
for more information.

Note that if you want to submit each chunk's analysis to a separate batch job, you must provide `batch_submit_preamble.sh` (which will not be tracked by git). This script must `echo` everything except the actual call of `call_hand_analysis.sh`. It will be called in a subshell of `hand_analysis_loop.sh`, so you can refer to that script's variables `$log_out` and `$log_err` to save logs of STDOUT and STDERR, respectively.

## `hand_analysis_1chunk.sh`

This script calls the Python script that does the analysis for one "chunk". `hand_analysis_loop.sh` calls this script in every iteration of its loop.
```bash
./hand_analysis_1chunk.sh --help
```

Your machine may need some additional code to be called before calling the HAND analysis Python script. You can put this in `1chunk_preamble.sh`, which will not be tracked by git.

## Example
These scripts were tested on NSF NCAR's Casper machine like so (bash). The analysis takes a long time---indeed, even with 12 hours of walltime, some of the chunks may not complete. (You can check if a chunk has completed by checking for its `done_` file in `$outdir`.) If that's the case, you can rerun this code as many times as needed, and the chunks that haven't completed will start where they left off.

```bash
# Preamble for submitting a PBS job. Note "echo echo".
echo echo qsub -V -q casper -A $PROJECT -l walltime=12:00:00 -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=32GB -o \${log_out} -e \${log_err} -- > batch_submit_preamble.sh

# Preamble for calling the HAND analysis Python script for a single chunk. Note "echo echo".
echo -e "module load ncarenv \n echo conda run -n Representative_Hillslopes" > 1chunk_preamble.sh
